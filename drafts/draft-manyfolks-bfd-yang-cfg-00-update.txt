1.  Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] is a data definition language that was introduced to
   define the contents of a conceptual data store that allows networked
   devices to be managed using NETCONF [RFC6241].  YANG is proving
   relevant beyond its initial confines, as bindings to other interfaces
   (e.g RESTCONF) and encodings other than XML (e.g JSON) are being
   defined.  Furthermore, YANG data models can be used as the basis of
   implementation for other interfaces, such as CLI and programmatic
   APIs.

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)[RFC5880].  BFD is

   a network protocol which is used for liveness detection of arbitrary
   paths between systems.  Some examples:

   1) Two systems directly connected via IP.  This is known as BFD over
   single-hop IP [RFC5881]

   2) Two systems connected via multiple hops [RFC5883]

   3) Two systems connected via MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
   [RFC5884]

   4) Two systems connected via a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface
   [RFC7130]

   BFD typically does not operate on its own.  Various control
   protocols, aka BFD clients, use the services provided by BFD for
   their own operation [RFC5882].  The obvious candidates which use BFD
   are those which do not have Hellos to detect failures (e.g. static
   routes) and routing protocols whose Hellos do not suport sub-second
   failure detection, e.g OSPF and IS-IS.

2.  Design of the Data Model

2.1.  Configuration model

   The configuration model consists mainly of the paramters specified in
   [RFC5880].  Some examples are desired minimum transmit interval,
   required minimum receive interval, deteciton multiplier etc

   TBD DO WE WANT TO LIST ALL CONFIG PARMS HERE???

   Some implementations have BFD configuration under the BFD client,
   e.g.  BFD configuration is under routing applications such as OSPF,
   IS-IS, BGP etc.  Other implementations have BFD configuration as
   standalone, i.e outside the BFD clients.  In the sections below we
   address both approaches.


2.1.1.  Configuration in BFD clients

   When BFD is configured in BFD clients, it is highly desirable to have
   BFD configuration consistency between those clients.  In this
   approach we have a grouping for BFD configuration which applications
   can import in their YANG module:

Internet-Draft                  BFD Yang                   February 2015


   - This provides consistency since the same grouping is being used in
   all applications making use of BFD

   - Since not all implementations of those BFD clients have support for
   BFD, we SHOULD use if-feature in the respective YANG modules

   An application importing the BFD configuration grouping could do so
   in a hierarchical manner if it has multiple levels at which BFD
   configuration can be applied.  In a subsequent section we provide an
   example of how a BFD client would use the grouping in such a way.

2.1.2.  Standalone BFD configuration

   Mahesh TBD

2.2.  Operational model

   The operational model containes both the overall statistics of BFD
   sessions running on the device and the per session operational
   statistics.  Since BFD is used for liveness detection of arbitrary
   paths, there is no uniform key to identify a BFD session. e.g. a BFD
   single-hop IP session is uniquely identified by the combination of
   destination IP address and interface whereas a multihop IP session is
   uniquely identified by the combination of source IP address,
   destination IP address and VRF.  For this reason, for per session
   operational statistics, we do not have a single list with different
   type BFD sessions.  Instead we have a container in which we have
   multiple lists, where each list corresponds to one specific path type
   for BFD.  For example we have one operational list for BFD single-hop
   IP, another list for BFD multi-hop IP etc.  In each list, mainly
   three categories of operational items are shown.  The fundamental
   information of a BFD session such as the local dscriminator, remote
   dscriminator and the capability of supporting demand detect mode are
   shown in the first category.  A second category includes a BFD
   session running information, e.g. the FSM the device in and
   diagnostic code received.  Another example is the actual transmit
   interval between the control packets, which may be different from the
   desired minimum transmit interval configured, is shown in this
   category.  Similar examples are actual received interval between the
   control pacekets and the actual transmit interval between the echo
   packets.  The third category contains the detailed statistics of this
   session, e.g. when the session went to up/down, how long it has been
   since the session is up/down.

2.4.  Configuration Data Hierarchy

2.4.1.  Configuration in BFD clients

   The following is the configuration data hierarchy for a hypothetical
   BFD client called bfd-routing-app, the BFD configuration is supported
   conditionally via use of if-feature.

   We have a list of areas and in each area we have a list of
   interfaces.  The BFD configuration grouping is used in a hierarchical
   fashion, it can be applied in "area" and "interface":

   - If BFD configuration is applied in an interface, that configuration
   takes precedence over any BFD configuration (if any) at the area
   level

   - If BFD configuration is applied in an "area" and none of the
   interafces in that area has BFD configuration, then all interfaces
   belong to the "area" in question inherit the BFD configuration for
   the area in question.
